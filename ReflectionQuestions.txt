1. Challenges Encountered: 
    I was limited in my knowledge and couldnt do much to Improve the game. 

2. How I Overcame the Challenges: 
    I had to go and take some other scripting Courses to improve my knowledge and skill.

3. Features to Implement if Given more time
I would Like to Implement Different levels of difficulty in the game as well as different scene levels.
